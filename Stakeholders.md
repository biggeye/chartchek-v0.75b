<blockquote>
<p><strong>Overview:</strong><br>
EMR-Supplement is designed to help behavioral health facilities meet and maintain compliance with accreditation bodies (like the Joint Commission and DHCS). The application guides facility owners through the certification process, manages critical documents, and offers an intelligent, conversation-driven assistant to support compliance tasks. Built using modern web technologies (Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind, and Supabase), it is structured to start as a single, integrated system—with a clear roadmap for future expansion.</p>

<h2 id="key-functional-areas">1. Key Functional Areas</h2>
<h3 id="a.-dashboard--reporting">A. Dashboard &amp; Reporting</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>What It Does:</strong><br>
Displays a clear picture of your facility’s compliance status in three areas: Facility, Patient Charts, and HR.</li>
<li><strong>Key Features:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Visual progress meters (e.g., percentages) with tooltips that explain each metric.</li>
<li>An enterprise summary that aggregates data across all your facilities.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="b.-onboarding--compliance-wizard">B. Onboarding &amp; Compliance Wizard</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Purpose:</strong><br>
The wizard gathers essential information to assess a new facility’s readiness for accreditation.</li>
<li><strong>How It Works:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Initial Setup:</strong> Collects basic details such as facility name, type (e.g., Residential Detox, Intensive Outpatient—small/large), capacity, and regulatory/licensing information.</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic Flow:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Depending on what is already known, the wizard may conclude early, guiding you to the next step (e.g., “Contact Joint Commission”, “Finish application”, “Pay application fee”).</li>
<li>This process is repeated whenever you add a new facility.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Accreditation Process (Using Joint Commission as an Example):</strong>
<ol>
<li><strong>Account Created:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Verify key prerequisites (like having served at least 3 clients).</li>
<li>Upload essential documents (such as SOPs, emergency maps, schedules, etc.). These documents are analyzed in the background to identify surveyable items.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Application Submitted:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Record application details including submission and fee payment.</li>
<li>The system then displays the next step based on confirmation or waiver options.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Ready Date Declared:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Set a target date (minimum 30 days out) for readiness, triggering a timeline that highlights remaining tasks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Post-Accreditation:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Once accredited, the system becomes a robust task manager, allowing you to track both required and custom administrative metrics.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="c.-compliance-items--metrics">C. Compliance Items &amp; Metrics</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>What They Are:</strong><br>
These are specific, checklist-like items tied to your accreditation manuals (e.g., sections of the Joint Commission manual).</li>
<li><strong>Details Captured:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Each item includes a title, description, category (and subcategory), reference index numbers, and version.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Customization:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Items are automatically mapped to your facility type.</li>
<li>The system calculates overall compliance scores based on weighted factors in each of the three main categories.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="d.-chat--intelligent-assistance">D. Chat &amp; Intelligent Assistance</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Purpose:</strong><br>
A conversation-driven interface where you can interact with “specialists” in Compliance, Accounts &amp; Billing, or HR.</li>
<li><strong>Key Features:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Threaded conversations that keep a history of your questions and responses.</li>
<li>The assistant (powered by a language model) provides guidance and can also revise documents.</li>
<li>You can attach files to conversations, and a simple modal helps you associate each file with a specific compliance item or category.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="e.-document-management">E. Document Management</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Functionality:</strong><br>
A central place to manage all your compliance-related documents.</li>
<li><strong>Key Features:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Upload files via drag-and-drop.</li>
<li>Organize documents into folders (with both list and grid views).</li>
<li>Rename, delete, and move files easily.</li>
<li>Basic search functionality to find documents quickly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Compliance:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Designed to meet HIPAA requirements with secure encryption and audit logs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="f.-staff--facilities-management">F. Staff &amp; Facilities Management</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Facilities Module:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Manage multiple facilities with a simple “+” button to add new ones.</li>
<li>Each facility card shows the name, type, capacity, and overall compliance score (with a breakdown available on hover).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Staff Module:</strong>
<ul>
<li>A basic module that displays staff details such as names, roles, and facility assignments.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="g.-notifications--calendar">G. Notifications &amp; Calendar</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>What It Does:</strong><br>
Alerts you to important events—such as document processing, upcoming deadlines, or changes in compliance status.</li>
<li><strong>Calendar Integration:</strong>
<ul>
<li>An integrated calendar displays key dates (e.g., ready dates) and milestones, giving you a timeline of tasks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="h.-audit-logging--phi-protection">H. Audit Logging &amp; PHI Protection</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Purpose:</strong><br>
To ensure that all actions involving patient data (PHI) are secure and fully traceable.</li>
<li><strong>Key Strategies:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Every significant action (login, file access, chat interactions) is logged.</li>
<li>A built-in anonymization layer scans outbound data, replacing sensitive PHI with placeholders before data is sent for analysis.</li>
<li>The system then restores the original data after processing, all while adhering to HIPAA guidelines.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
