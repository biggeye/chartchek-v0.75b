Vendor‑Agnostic Chat System Integration

Objective: • Reverse‑engineer the current OpenAI Assistants API integration and re‑design the system to support multiple backend providers (e.g., OpenAI, Gemini, Deepseek) via a unified, non‑opinionated interface. • Repurpose the “threads” nomenclature as the primary key for indexing and tracking user conversations in Supabase/PostgreSQL, ensuring data integrity and persistence.

Core Architecture: • UI Layer: Built with React components that interface with Zustand stores. – chatStore.ts: Manages chat state and user interactions. – streamStore.ts: Handles streaming state during live conversations. • API (Local): A collection of Next.js API routes acting as a middleware between the UI and external vendors. • Service Layers (e.g., servicelayers.ts): Encapsulate vendor‑specific calls (currently OpenAI) and serve as the abstraction layer. • PostgreSQL Layer: Acts as a duplicate record store to index and track conversation threads while the external vendor remains the source of truth.

Design Guidelines:

Abstraction & Modularity – Refactor serviceLayers.ts (and similar modules) to expose a provider‑agnostic interface. Design adapter modules for each vendor so that calls (e.g., creating a run, sending a message, retrieving thread data) can be switched seamlessly. – Maintain a clear separation between UI/state management (Zustand stores) and backend API logic.

Thread‑Centric Conversation Indexing – Use “threads” as the central data structure for conversations. Every incoming message or update must be linked to a unique thread ID. – All conversation metadata, message history, and run state updates must be mirrored in PostgreSQL via Supabase to ensure robust conversation indexing and enable historical queries.

Data Integrity & Synchronization – While the external API (e.g., OpenAI) remains the source of truth, duplicate essential records (e.g., run IDs, message IDs, thread metadata) into PostgreSQL. This enables efficient querying, auditing, and error recovery. – Implement error handling and retry mechanisms that reconcile differences between the external vendor’s state and the local PostgreSQL records.

Vendor-Agnostic Operations – Ensure that the API layer (local endpoints) and the service layers treat vendor-specific details as implementation details. All business logic (e.g., updating thread state, processing message deltas, rendering conversation history) should operate on a standardized data structure. – When processing a message (via threadService.ts) or formatting a conversation (via renderService.ts), the system should be agnostic to the underlying vendor, using only the standardized format provided by the abstraction layer.

Incremental Refactoring & Extensibility – Begin by isolating the OpenAI-specific logic and replacing it with an abstraction that supports a unified API interface. – Design the new interface to allow plug-and-play support for other vendors. The LLM should generate adapters that conform to this interface without altering the overall application flow. – Preserve the current compartmentalization to minimize disruption—continue to leverage the existing Zustand stores and API routes while gradually migrating the service layers.

Usage for LLM Consumption: • The LLM should process incoming requests by: – Determining which adapter (or vendor-specific implementation) to call based on configuration or runtime parameters. – Transforming vendor-specific responses into a standardized format for further processing (e.g., updating thread metadata in Supabase). – Coordinating between the UI state (chatStore/streamStore) and the persistent store (PostgreSQL) by ensuring that any new vendor integration maintains the existing data flow and state synchronization. • The LLM must also generate detailed error and logging mechanisms to facilitate debugging and operational visibility during the transition.
